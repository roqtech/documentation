# Fetch files

## Fetch files using API

ROQ Platform provides an API to fetch files from the ROQ Platform. The API is available at the generated SDK.

### Fetch all files

We can use the `files()` API to fetch all files belonging to the current owner. For example, to fetch files in the Next.js application, you can use the following code:

```tsx {5}
import { roqBrowserClient } from "lib/roq/roq-client"

const fetchFiles = async () => {
    try {
        const dataList = await roqBrowserClient.roqPlatform.files();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching files:', error);
    }
};
```

The `files` API is live on the ROQ Platform, and it's guaranteed to be available. Whatever data model you use, you can always fetch files from the ROQ Platform.

<Callout type="info">
How does the files API know who the current owner is? The owner is determined by the `roqBrowserClient`. It will get the current user token and use the token for every file request.
</Callout>

### Fetch files with filters

The `files` API also accepts filters. For example, to fetch files with a file category equal to `USER_FILES`, you can use the following code:

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from "lib/roq/roq-client"

const fetchFilesWithFilters = async () => {
    try {
        const dataList = await roqBrowserClient.roqPlatform.files({
            filter: {
                fileCategory: {
                    equalTo: "USER_FILES"
                }
            }, limit: 20
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching files:', error);
    }
};
```

The code above will fetch files with a file category equal to `USER_FILES` and limit the result to 20 files. Please look here for more information about [file category](/files/manage-file-categories).



## Fetch files using file associations

ROQ Platform provides a way to associate files with data models. For example, you can associate files with a project. To retrieve files linked with the project, you can filter files based on the `entityName` which is `project`:

```tsx
const fetchFileAssociations = async () => {
    try {
        const dataList = await roqBrowserClient.roqPlatform.files({
            filter: {
                entityName: {
                    equalTo: "project"
                }
            }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching file associations:', error);
    }
}
```

The code above will fetch files associated with the project and files belonging to the current owner. Please look here for more information about [file API](/files/api).
