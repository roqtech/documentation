# Files Management UI Components

<DoBasicSetup />

## `<FileUpload/>`

### Description

The `<FileUpload/>` component represents a button which opens a file selector and starts uploads. Please refer to
the [files feature guide](/files) for more information and instructions. 

<Tabs items={['Light', 'Dark']}><Tab>

<Image src={"/upload-file-light.png"} alt="file-upload-light" width={153} height={60} />

</Tab><Tab>

<Image src={"/upload-file-dark.png"} alt="file-upload-light" width={153} height={60} />

</Tab></Tabs>

### Integration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This component can be used in various ways. A good way to learn about it, is to look into the implementation of the 
Kickstarter: [/src/components/file/upload-file.tsx](https://github.com/roqtech/roq-kickstarter-nextjs/blob/main/src/components/file/upload-file.tsx)
</Callout>

You can easily add the `<FileUpload/>` component to your application by adding this code snippet to your component:

{/* TODO Replace code example */}

<Tabs items={['React']}><Tab>

```tsx
import {FileUpload} from "@roq/nextjs";

<FileUpload
    accept={["image/*"]}
    fileCategory="USER_FILES"
    onUploadSuccess={({url, id, ...rest}) => {
        console.log({id, url});
        // optional: send file ID to server-side by calling your API 
    }}
/>
```

</Tab></Tabs>

### Success handler

After the file was uploaded, the `onUploadSuccess` handler is called. This way you can send the file ID to your backend
application, which is required in one of these cases:

* you want to relate the file to another object
* you want to change the visibility of the file (e.g. from "public" to "private").

Read more about these concepts in the [tutorials](/files/tutorials) section.
