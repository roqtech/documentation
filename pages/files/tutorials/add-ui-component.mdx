# Add the UI Component

ROQ provides two UI Components which can be used to upload files:

1. The [**`<FileUpload/>`**](/files/ui-components#fileupload) component represents a button that opens a file selector and starts uploads.

2. The [**`<FileDropzone/>`**](/files/ui-components#filedropzone) UI component represents an area on your application where users can drag and drop files to be uploaded.

Please follow the respective instructions to integrate the UI component into your website. You'll need to pass the `key` of the previously created category as a prop.


## Add `<FileUpload>` Into Application

<Callout type="info">
For this example, please check out the generated application code in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roq-ai-snapshot/youtubiah-8b47). 
</Callout>

Add the `<FileUpload>` UI component into the existing application code:

```tsx
// src\pages\videos\create\index.tsx
import { 
	AccessOperationEnum, 
	AccessServiceEnum, 
	requireNextAuth, 
	withAuthorization, 
	FileUpload 
} from '@roq/nextjs';
```

Add the `<FileUpload/>` to the existing video form:

```tsx
// src\pages\videos\create\index.tsx
<FormControl id="file" mb="4">
	<FormLabel>Upload File</FormLabel>
    <FileUpload 
		accept={['video/*']} fileCategory="USER_FILES"
        onUploadSuccess={({ url, id, ...rest }) => {
            console.log({ id, url });
            formik.setFieldValue("fileUrl", url);
            formik.setFieldValue("fileId", id);
        }}
		onUploadFail={(err => {
			console.log(err)
		})}
    />
</FormControl>
```

The `<FileUpload/>`  UI component above will only accept video file type and the uploaded file will be save in **USER_FILES** category (please look into the ROQ Console for file categories). The reult of file upload are `fileUrl` and `fileId`. 


In the generated application, go to the **Videos** side menu and the `<FileUpload/>` will be added to the video form.

![add fileupload component](/add-file-upload.png)

To upload a video file just click the **+ Upload File** button and select the video you want to upload.

![video-upload-file](/video-file-upload.png)

The video will directly uploaded to the data server and the response will be set in the `formik` state as `fileUrl` and `fileId`.

<Callout type="info">
As we [mentioned earlier](/files#file-uploads), `<FileUpload/>` UI component will directly upload the file into the data center using _**signed URLs**_ and the results data that will be saved into the application database. 
</Callout>

For this example, the data that will be saved upon succesfully file upload:

```js
{
  title: 'The Sea',
  description: 'Beautiful Sea Video',
  url: 'https://antvideos.net/sea.mp4',
  fileUrl: 'https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/1e4eba76-328d-4cf0-b478-41076a6b83b3-environment-bucket/sea-1690048762556.mp4',      
  fileId: 'c6d563dc-1441-4729-9fa5-cca0eeccd518',
  organization_id: 'k0sal34alksa-e1edklwe49320s',
  user_id: 'fe7885b3-5667-41e0-b478-6aa43e0635b5'
}
```

There are still few changes to the code so the upload file data will be recorded on the database.

<Steps>
### Change The Interface

You need to change the `VideoInterface` and added these two fields: `fileUrl` and `fileId`, both of these fields has a `string` type.

```tsx
// src\interfaces\video\index.ts
export interface VideoInterface {
  id?: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  url?: string;
  fileUrl?: string,
  fileId?: string,
  organization_id?: string;
  user_id?: string;
  created_at?: any;
  updated_at?: any;
  comment?: CommentInterface[];
  organization?: OrganizationInterface;
  user?: UserInterface;
  _count?: {
    comment?: number;
  };
}

export interface VideoGetQueryInterface extends GetQueryInterface {
  id?: string;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  fileUrl?: string;
  fileId?: string;
  organization_id?: string;
  user_id?: string;
}
```

### Modify The Prisma Schema

To save the `fileUrl` and `fileId` to the database, the Prisma schema should be changed too.

```js
model video {
  id              String        @id @default(dbgenerated("uuid_generate_v4()")) @db.Uuid
  title           String        @db.VarChar(255)
  description     String?       @db.VarChar(255)
  url             String        @db.VarChar(255)
  fileUrl         String?       @db.Text
  fileId          String?       @db.VarChar(255)
  organization_id String?       @db.Uuid
  user_id         String?       @db.Uuid
  created_at      DateTime      @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
  updated_at      DateTime      @default(now()) @db.Timestamp(6)
  comment         comment[]
  organization    organization? @relation(fields: [organization_id], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
  user            user?         @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id], onDelete: NoAction, onUpdate: NoAction)
}
```

Here's the `fileUrl` type is set to `Text` because the uploaded URL can be longer than 255 characters. To reflect the changes in the Prisma schema on the database, you need to run:

```shell
npx prisma regenerate

npx prisma migrate deploy
```

and if you use PostgreSQL for the database and pgAdmin for the administration tool, you will see the data is saved on the **video** table.
