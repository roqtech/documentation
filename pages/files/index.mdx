# Overview

## Uploading and storing files

ROQ SDK for BaaS simplifies file uploading and storage for SaaS applications. Developers can directly implement file upload features based on the front-end SDK using any web frameworks. 

For more information on uploading files, please see the documentation section on [Uploading Files](/files/uploading-files). For a practical example of uploading a file in Next.js, check out the [Add File Uploads](/next-js/add-file-uploads) tutorial.

Files uploaded to the ROQ Platform are stored on [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). The data center is located in Paris.
