### ROQ Social Sign-in

In all social sign-ins, you need to set up these two credentials on the ROQ Console:

* **Client ID**: Client ID for web application
* **Client Secret**: Client Secret for web application

These credentials are used to authenticate user login or signup with the social sign-in provider.

### Google OAuth 

<Callout type="warning">
You must follow this [guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) first to set up OAuth 2.0 and then continue with the guide below.

In the Google OAuth setting page, you need to set these two mandatory fields:

    #### Authorized Redirect URIs 

    This URI setting is used to redirect users after they have authenticated with Google. Fill this with **Auth Redirect URI** from the ROQ Social Sign-in page.

    ```shell
    https://2d8rgp5gn9qjobt4wfrraicmc.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com/oauth/google/redirect
    ```

    #### Authorized JavaScript Origins

    The HTTP origins that host your web application. This value can't contain wildcards or paths. The value must be the authentication hostname of the environment: 

    ```shell
    https://<prefix>.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com
    ```

    That is:

    ```shell
    https://2d8rgp5gn9qjobt4wfrraicmc.auth.jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com
    ```
    The settings for both options are displayed in the screenshot below.

    Once activated, Google Sign-in can be used as a registration or login option. The next step is to add this Google Sign-in to the registration form.

## How to Add Social Sign-in

To add **Google Sign-In** to the login or registration form variants, you should enable it in the **Social Sign-in** options. Go here for more information about [customize the registration form](/user-registration/registration-forms#sign-in-options).
