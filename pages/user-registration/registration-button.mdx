# Registration button

## Add registration button to your app

To add a registration or signup button to your application, you need to add a button that links to the signup page. ROQ provides a generated SDK that you can use to connect to the signup page, and the authentication feature is framework-agnostic and can be used in any framework supported by ROQ.

Here is an example of how to add a signup button to your application using Next.js:

```jsx
import {roqBrowserClient} from "@/lib/roq/roq-client"

export default function SignupButton() {
  return (
	<button
	  onClick={() => {
		roqBrowserClient.signUp()
	  }}
	>
	  Signup
	</button>
  )
}
```

By default without any parameter passed to the `signUp()` function, the registration page that will be shown to the user is the default registration page. You can configure the registration form in the ROQ Console or create another registration form.

The registration page is a managed page that is hosted by ROQ and can be configured to have your own branding. The registration forms has keys that late you can use in the `signUp()` function. 

For example, if you have a registration form with the key `developer`, you can use the following code to open the registration page with your custom form:

```jsx
import {roqBrowserClient} from "@/lib/roq/roq-client"

export default function SignupButton() {
  return (
	<button
	  onClick={() => {
		roqBrowserClient.signUp("developer")
	  }}
	>
	  Signup
	</button>
  )
}
```

## Redirect after registration

After the user has registered, you can redirect the user to a specific page. To do so, you need to pass the `postLoginRedirect` optional parameter to the `signUp()` function. 

For example, if you want to redirect the user to the dashboard page after registration, you can use the following code:

```jsx
import {roqBrowserClient} from "@/lib/roq/roq-client"

export default function SignupButton() {
  return (
	<button
	  onClick={() => {
		roqBrowserClient.signUp("developer", { postLoginRedirect: "/dashboard"})
	  }}
	>
	  Signup
	</button>
  )
}
```
