# User registration

## Introduction

ROQ BaaS SDK provides a complete and secure authentication and user management solution for your application.

**Key Features:**

- Customizable user login and registration
- Full multi-tenancy support (e.g., creation of new organizations during signup)
- Secure session handling for your application
- Social sign-in with Google, Github, or Facebook
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
- User invites
- 360-degree view of all user data

## How It Works

ROQ's login and session management are based on the [OAuth protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). Here is how it works:

1. The user clicks the **Signup** button and will redirected to a signup page provided by ROQ.
2. ROQ prompts the user to register using username and password or social sign-ins (e.g. Google) and then sends a special token back indicating that the user has granted permission to access your web application.
