The chat system uses a secure websocket socket connection to send and receive realtime messages. It can be integrated
into your application within a few minutes and customized to your requirements. It is highly flexible, and using a
combination of the customizable UI widgets for chat and the API; you could achieve a wide range of flexibility - from a
private messenger-like experience to even a slack-like experience.

Highlights:

* One-to-one chats
* Conversations among multiple users
* Rich-text editor for messages
* File-uploads

## UI Components

ROQ’s chat system is rendered by these UI components:

1. The [**`<Chat/>`**](/ui-components/chat) UI component represents the chat message center with sidebar and the chat
   window.
2. The [**`<MessageBell/>`**](/ui-components/chat-message-bell) component renders an icon symbol which informs the user
   about incoming message.
