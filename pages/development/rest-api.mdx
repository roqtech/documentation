# REST API

ROQ use JSON:API specification to minimizes the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers. Its design allows for fetching, creating, and updating multiple resources in a single request, making operations more efficient.

## JSON:API

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests. It provides guidelines for structuring requests, responses, and the HTTP methods and status codes to employ. It embraces RESTful conventions, however, it also defines conventions for building and modifying resources via HTTP.

### Features

- Standardizes how APIs are designed and how requests and responses are handled, promoting interoperability.
- Specifies the use of JSON in request and response bodies, with conventions for how resources and their relationships should be represented.
- Supports fetching and modifying resources, and provides mechanisms for transactions and error handling.
- Embraces RESTful principles, but also includes conventions for actions not covered by REST.
