# Prerequisites

Before starting the project development using ROQ BaaS SDK, you must ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Generate the initial application using our [AI-Assisted SaaS Builder](https://app.roq.ai/). This process will also generate the ROQ Backend as a Service (BaaS) as part of the generated application.
2. Signup in [Console](https://console.roq.tech) to manage the generated application.
3. Create a new project using a framework of your choice for app development (e.g. Next.js, Nuxt.js, RedwoodJS, SvelteKit, etc.). 
4. Set up the new project to use ROQ BaaS SDK.

For more information on how to create a new project (step 3), set up the project (step 4) and install ROQ BaaS SDK, see [installation](/development/sdk/installation).
