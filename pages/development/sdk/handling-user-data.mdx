# Handling user data

The user data exists on both the BaaS and ROQ Platform and is synced. However, some changes can only be made via the ROQ Platform.

{/*
| System      | Operation   | Data Sync  |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROQ Platform| Create User | The user is created on ROQ Platform & the user is also created on BaaS |
| ROQ Platform| Update User | The user is updated on ROQ Platform & the user is also updated on BaaS |
| ROQ Platform| Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED. The user can be set inactive instead |
| BaaS        | Create User | NOT SUPPORTED  |
| BaaS        | Update User | The user is updated on BaaS & the user is also updated on ROQ Platform |
| BaaS        | Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED  |

## Create user

The creation of new user is only supported via the ROQ Platform. Whenever a new user is created in the ROQ Platform, the user is also created on the BaaS. The new user can be created from an invitation from the ROQ Console or created via the ROQ Platform API.

```tsx
import {} from "/lib/roq/"

```


## Update user

## Delete user
