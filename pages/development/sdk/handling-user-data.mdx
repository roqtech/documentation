# Handling user data

The user data exists on both the BaaS and ROQ Platform, and it is synced. However, some changes can only be made via the ROQ Platform.

{/*
| System      | Operation   | Data Sync  |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROQ Platform| Create User | The user is created on ROQ Platform & the user is also created on BaaS |
| ROQ Platform| Update User | The user is updated on ROQ Platform & the user is also updated on BaaS |
| ROQ Platform| Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED. The user can be set inactive instead |
| BaaS        | Create User | NOT SUPPORTED  |
| BaaS        | Update User | The user is updated on BaaS & the user is also updated on ROQ Platform |
| BaaS        | Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED  |

## Create user

Creating new users is only possible through the ROQ Platform. When a new user is created on the ROQ Platform, a corresponding user account is also created on the BaaS. You can create a new user by sending an invitation from the Console, user signup or by using the `createUser` from server side API.

Let's take an example of creating a new user using the `createUser` API on the Next.js framework.

```tsx filename="actions.ts"
"use server"

import crypto from "crypto";
import {roqServerClient} from "lib/roq/roq-server-client";

export async function createNewUser({ email, tenantId, roles, password }: { email: string, tenantId: string, roles: string[], password: string }) {
    const newUser = await roqServerClient.roqPlatform.asSuperAdmin().createUser({
        user: {
            email,
            reference: crypto.randomUUID(),
            tenantId,
            roles,
            password
        }
    })
}
```

We can call the code from the client side later on the `page.tsx` file.

```tsx filename="pages.tsx"
"use client"

import { useSession } from "@/lib/roq/roq-hooks";
import { createNewUser} from "./actions"

export default function CreateUser() {
    const { session } = useSession();
    const tenantId = session?.user.tenantId as string;

    const userPayload = {
        email: "Francis.99@roq.dev",
        password: "secret",
        tenantId: tenantId,
        roles: ["freelancer"]
    }
    
    function handleCreateUser() {
        createNewUser(userPayload);
    }
    return (
        <button onClick={createUserHandler}>Create User</button>
    )
}
```

The code will create a new user in the ROQ Platform and also sync on BaaS. We can check this user on the Console and also using BaaS API.

Check user using BaaS API (hooks):

```tsx
import { useUserFindMany } from "@/lib/roq";

const { data: users } = useUserFindMany();
```

We can summarize the user data sync as follows:

| System      | Operation   | Data Sync  |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROQ Platform| Create User | The user is created on ROQ Platform & the user is also created on BaaS |
| BaaS        | Create User | NOT SUPPORTED  |


## Update user

Update user data can be done on both the ROQ Platform and BaaS. We can update it using the Console or BaaS API. From the client side, we can update the user data using the `update` BaaS API method from the generated SDK and from the server side, we can use the `updateUser` API method from the ROQ Platform.

For example, we can update the user data using the `update` API on the Next.js framework.

```tsx
import {roqBrowserClient} from "@/lib/roq/roq-client";

const updateData = async () => {
    const result = await roqBrowserClient.user.update({
        data: {
            first_name: "Francis",
            last_name: "Webb"
          },
          where: {
            email: "Francis.99@roq.dev",
            id: "32546e0b-eada-48a8-93d9-f6e5d1f85b3d"
        }
    })
}
```

| System      | Operation   | Data Sync  |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROQ Platform| Update User | The user is updated on ROQ Platform & the user is also updated on BaaS |
| BaaS        | Update User | The user is updated on BaaS & the user is also updated on ROQ Platform |ÃŸ

## Delete user

Currently, deleting a user is not supported. However, you can set the user to inactive. This can be done using the Console.

| System      | Operation   | Data Sync  |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROQ Platform| Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED. The user can be set inactive instead |
| BaaS        | Delete User | NOT SUPPORTED  |
