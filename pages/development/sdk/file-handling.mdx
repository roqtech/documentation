# File handling

## Overview

ROQ SDK for BaaS provides a complete solution for file management, including these features:

- File upload.
- File management (create ,read, update, and delete file).
- Files visibility (public or private).
- File categories.

File management from a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) perspective involves providing client applications with APIs and services to handle, store, retrieve, and manipulate files on remote servers without the need for developers to build and maintain their backend infrastructure. 

ROQ SDK for BaaS provides all these functionality whether through API or ROQ Console. There are two SDKs: the front-end SDK and back-end SDK. 

## Front-end SDK

The front-end SDK provides us with the neccessary API for file handling from the client side. These APIs are ROQ platform features and it's consumable for any supporting JavaScript frameworks.
