# Authentication

ROQ provides a complete and secure authentication solution for SaaS application development.

Key Features:

- Customizable user login and registration (customization on ROQ Console)
- Full multi-tenancy support (e.g., creation of new organizations during sign-up)
- Secure session handling for your application
- Social sign-in with Google, Github, or Facebook (setup on ROQ Console)
- Multi-factor Authentication or MFA (setup on ROQ Console) 
- User invites
- 360-degree view of all user data

## How It Works

ROQ's authentication and session management are based on the [OAuth protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). Here is how it works:

1. The user clicks the Login button or is redirected to a login page provided by ROQ.
2. ROQ prompts the user to log in using username and password or social sign-ins (e.g. Google) and then sends a special token back indicating that the user has granted permission to access your web application.
3. Using the authentication wrapper such as `requireNextAuth` for Next.js, you can easily define which pages are only accessible to authenticated users.

## API

The front-end SDK provides authentication helper functions for redirecting users to the sign-in and sign-up pages and a function to clean the session upon logout.

Here is the summary of the most important API for authentication:

| Function | Description                              | Code                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| signIn   | Redirect users to the sign-in page.      | `roqClient.signIn()`  |
| signUp   | Redirect users to the sign-up page.      | `roqClient.signUp()`  |
| logout   | Clean the session upon logout.           | `roqClient.logout()`  |

As mentioned earlier, every successful sign-in or sign-up generates a special token. In frameworks like Next.js, this token is saved in the browser's cookie as `roq-session-token`.
