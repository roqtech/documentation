# Authentication

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete and secure authentication solution for SaaS application development.

Key Features:

- Customizable user login and registration (customization on ROQ Console)
- Full multi-tenancy support (e.g., creation of new organizations during sign-up)
- Secure session handling for your application
- Social sign-in with Google, Github, or Facebook (setup on ROQ Console)
- Multi-factor Authentication or MFA (setup on ROQ Console) 
- User invites
- 360-degree view of all user data

## How It Works

ROQ's authentication and session management are based on the [OAuth protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). Here is how it works:

1. The user clicks the Login button or is redirected to a login page provided by ROQ.
2. ROQ prompts the user to log in using username and password or social sign-ins (e.g., Google) and then sends a special token back indicating that the user has granted permission to access your web application.
3. Using the authentication wrapper such as `requireNextAuth` for Next.js, you can easily define which pages are only accessible to authenticated users.

## API

All authentication APIs on the client side are live by default in the `/lib/roq` folder, and all authentication APIs are accessible through the ROQ client `useRoqClient()` method.

The front-end SDK provides authentication helper functions for redirecting users to the sign-in and sign-up pages and a function to clean the session upon logout.

Here is the summary of the most important API for authentication:

### `signIn`

Redirect users to the sign-in page.

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.signIn()
```

### `signUp`

Redirect users to the sign-up page.

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.signUp()
```

### `logout`

Clean the session.

```tsximport { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.logout()
```

## Framework integration

As mentioned earlier, every successful sign-in or sign-up generates a special token. This token is saved in the browser's cookie as `roq-session-token`. Any JavaScript framework can utilize this token.

For practical examples, check out [add authentication](/next-js/add-authentication). This detailed documentation explains how to sign in, log out, and sign up for a Next.js project.
