# Authentication

ROQ provides a complete and secure authentication solution for SaaS application development.

Key Features:

- Customizable user login and registration (customisation on ROQ Console)
- Full multi-tenancy support (e.g., creation of new organizations during signup)
- Secure session handling for your application
- Social sign-in with Google, Github, or Facebook (setup on ROQ Console)
- Multi-factor Authentication or MFA (setup on ROQ Console) 
- User invites
- 360-degree view of all user data

## How It Works

ROQ's authentication and session management are based on the [OAuth protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). Here is how it works:

1. The user clicks the Login button or is redirected to a login page provided by ROQ.
2. ROQ prompts the user to log in using username and password or social sign-ins (e.g. Google) and then sends a special token back indicating that the user has granted permission to access your web application.
3. Using the authentication wrapper such as `requireNextAuth` for Next.js, you can easily define which pages are only accessible to authenticated users.
