# Authentication

## Introduction

The generated SDK provides a set of APIs to authenticate users. All authentication APIs on the client side are live by default in the `/lib/roq` folder, and all authentication APIs are accessible through the ROQ client `roqBrowserClient` API. 

To use it in your application, you need to import it from the SDK:

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';
```

The API will redirecting users to the sign-in and sign-up pages and clean the session upon logout.

For more information about user registration or authentication, check out this [documentation](/user-registration) section.
</Callout>

## Code examples

Here is code examples for the most important API for authentication: **signIn**, **signUp**, and **logout**.

### `signIn`

Redirect users to the sign-in page.

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.signIn()
```

### `signUp`

Redirect users to the sign-up page.

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.signUp()
```

### `logout`

Clean the session.

```tsx
import { roqBrowserClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-client';

roqBrowserClient.logout()
```

## Framework integration

As mentioned earlier, every successful sign-in or sign-up generates a special token. This token is saved in the browser's cookie as `roq-session-token`. Any JavaScript framework can utilize this token.

For practical examples, check out [add authentication](/next-js/add-authentication). This detailed documentation explains how to sign in, log out, and sign up for a Next.js project.
