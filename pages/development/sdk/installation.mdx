# Installation

The SDK for ROQ BaaS currently supports the following frameworks: **Next.js**, **Nuxt.js**, **RedwoodJS**, **SvelteKit**, and **Express.js**.

These are common steps to install the SDK for all supported frameworks:

<Steps>

{/*
### Generate the application using ROQ AI Assistant

    Go to [**app.roq.ai**](https://app.roq.ai/).
    
    Start by creating a new application with the help of the AI Assistant. The AI Assistant will guide you through the process, generating a new application for you. Once generated, you can configure your application via the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech). The console will provide you with the necessary environment values. You'll need these values for the SDK generation process.

    The generation process will also create ROQ BaaS resources for you, such as API to access your data.

### Create a custom application 

    Create a custom application using one of the supported frameworks. 
    
    For example, to create a Next.js application, run the following command:

    ```shell
    npx create-next-app@latest
    ```

### Copy `.env`

    Copy the environment values from ROQ Console into the `.env` file in the custom application. For local development, you can choose the **Local Environment** on Console.

    ![copy env from console](/gifs/copy-env-from-console.gif)

    After copy the environment values, create file `.env` in the root directory of project and paste the environment values. It is recommended to change the `ROQ_SECRET` environment value into a more secure value. The default value is `CHANGE_THIS_SECRET`.
     
### Install CLI SDK
    
    Install `@roq/cli` command line tool. This tool will help you generate a custom SDK specifically tailored to the application that you have created.

    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev @roq/cli
    ```

    Once the installation is complete, you can generate the SDK using the following command:

    ```shell
    npx @roq/cli generate
    ```
    
    You will be prompted with a few questions. The generated SDK will be placed, by default, in the `src/lib/roq` folder at the root of your application, and this CLI will automatically detect `ROQ_API_URL` from your `.env` file.

    ```shell
    Please provide ROQ_API_URL … https://book-story-v1-ca2b-baas.vercel.app
    ✔ Enter the SDK path (default: src/lib/roq): … src/lib/roq
    ✔ Write SDK to src/lib/roq. Proceed? … yes
    ```

### Install SDK 

    Install the ROQ BaaS SDK for a specific framework using the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install --save @roq/<framework>
    ```

    <Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
    <Tab>
    To install SDK for Next.js:

    ```shell
    npm install --save @roq/nextjs
    ```
    For a practical example, please refer to the [**quickstart on Next.js**](/next-js/quickstart). It covers the SDK generation using `@roq/cli`, authentication using `@roq/next.js`, and simple data access to ROQ BaaS.
