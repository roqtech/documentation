# Installation

The SDK for ROQ BaaS currently supports the following frameworks: Next.js, Nuxt.js, RedwoodJS, SvelteKit, and Express.js.

After generate the application using ROQ AI Assistant and you want to develop your own application using one of the supported frameworks, you need to install `@roq/cli` command line tool first. This tool will help you generate a custom SDK specifically tailored to the application that you have created.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @roq/cli
```

If you want to use the SDK with your Next.js application, please refer to the [**quickstart**](/next-js/quickstart) documentation. It covers the SDK generation using `@roq/cli`, authentication using `@roq/next.js`, and simple data access to BaaS.
