# Overview

## SDK

ROQ BaaS SDK is a collection of packages and tools that allows for creating SaaS applications supporting various web frameworks such as Express, Next.js, Nuxt.js, RedwoodJS, or SvelteKit. With this SDK, you can streamline the fetching, manipulation, and storage of data in the BaaS database. The SDK also handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure app interactions and additional features such as file handling, user profiles, and user invites, enhancing the application's capability.

The SDK offers mainly two variations: **client-side** or frontend SDK and **server-side** or backend SDK.

### Frontend SDK

For the client side, the SDK serves primary purposes:

- **Access to the BaaS database** (via Rest API)
- **Interaction with ROQ Platform** (via GraphQL)
- **Redirects to hosted pages**

The Frontend SDK is generated by our CLI tool from `@roq/cli` package. It specifically tailored for front-end development. The generated code provides functionality for interacting with BaaS and passes cookies with each request, so they are used for user request validation.

Furthermore, the benefits of the generated front-end SDK include:

- **Customization**: Tailored to fit the specific requirements and configurations of your front-end project. If you need to make changes to the project schema, you can do so using the ROQ Console and then regenerate the SDK.
- **Easy Integration**: The API generated in the SDK is designed to be easily integrated with modern front-end frameworks and libraries.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent interaction patterns with the backend, reducing potential integration issues.

### Server side

The server-side SDK includes the following:

- **Auth-handlers** (specific per framework)
- **ROQ Node.js SDK** (for interaction with ROQ Platform)
- **BaaS SDK** (with and without access management)

### Data access

The Frontend SDK simplifies BaaS database access on the client and leverages the ROQ platform also the API uses Prisma-like syntax that is easy to understand.

For information on accessing data in applications like Next.js, check out the documentation on [Accessing Data](/next-js/accessing-the-data). To learn about query syntax, visit the [Query Syntax](/development/sdk/query-syntax) documentation.


### Authentication

SaaS application always need authentication. This authentication is handled by the ROQ platform, hence the developers don't need to implement it froms the scracth. The Frontend SDK has helper functions for easy authentication. 

You can visit [Authentication](/development/sdk/authentication) to learn more about authentication. For practical examples, check out [Add Authentication](/next-js/add-authentication). This detailed documentation explains how to add login, logout, and signup to a Next.js project.

### Additional features

ROQ also provides authentication, user invites, file upload, and user profiles via the ROQ platform. Developers can access them easily using the frontend SDK.

For more practical example, visit quickstart on [Add User Profile](/next-js/add-the-user-profile), [Add User Invite](/next-js/add-user-invites), and [Add File Uploads](/next-js/add-file-uploads) to a Next.js project.

## Quickstart

If you want to use the SDK with your Next.js application, please refer to the [**Quickstart**](/next-js/quickstart) documentation. It covers the SDK generation using `@roq/cli`, authentication using `@roq/next.js`, and a simple data access to BaaS.
