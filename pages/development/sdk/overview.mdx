# Overview

ROQ BaaS SDK is a software development kit that allows for creating SaaS applications supporting various web frameworks such as Express, Next.js, Nuxt.js, RedwoodJS, or SvelteKit.

With this SDK, you can streamline the fetching, manipulation, and storage of data in the BaaS database. The SDK also handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure app interactions and additional features such as file handling, user profiles, and user invites, enhancing the application's capability.

The SDK offers two variations: **client-side** and **server-side**. For the client side, the SDK serves two primary purposes:

- **Access to the BaaS database** (via Rest API)
- **Interaction with ROQ Platform** (via GraphQL)

If you would like to use the client-side SDK with your Next.js application, please refer to the [**Quickstart**](/next-js/quickstart) documentation.
