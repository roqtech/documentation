# Overview

## SDK

ROQ BaaS SDK is a collection of libraries and tools that allows for creating SaaS applications supporting various web frameworks such as Express, Next.js, Nuxt.js, RedwoodJS, or SvelteKit.

With this SDK, you can streamline the fetching, manipulation, and storage of data in the BaaS database. The SDK also handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure app interactions and additional features such as file handling, user profiles, and user invites, enhancing the application's capability.

The SDK offers mainly two variations: **client-side** and **server-side**. 

### Client side

For the client side, the SDK serves two primary purposes:

- **Access to the BaaS database** (via Rest API)
- **Interaction with ROQ Platform** (via GraphQL)

It is important to note that there are different SDKs available for various frameworks. For example, if you are using the Next.js application, you will need to use the `@roq/nextjs` package as well as the specialized SDK generated by `@roq/cli`. The generated SDK is necessary because the project is initially created by ROQ AI Assistant based on your requirements.

#### Generated SDK

The `@roq/cli` tool offers functionality to generate an SDK specifically tailored for front-end development. This generated SDK provides a convenient and efficient way for front-end developers to integrate and communicate with the ROQ BaaS seamlessly.

The benefits of the generated front-end SDK include:

- **Customization**: Tailored to fit the specific requirements and configurations of your front-end project. If you need to make changes to the project schema, you can do so using the ROQ Console and then regenerate the SDK.
- **Easy Integration**: The API generated in the SDK is designed to be easily integrated with modern front-end frameworks and libraries.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent interaction patterns with the backend, reducing potential integration issues.

### Server side

The server-side SDK includes the following:

- **Auth-handlers** (specific per framework)
- **ROQ Node.js SDK** (for interaction with ROQ Platform)
- **BaaS SDK** (with and without access management)


### Data Access

The generated SDK simplifies BaaS database access on the client and leverages the ROQ platform also the API uses Prisma-like syntax that is easy to understand.

For information on accessing data in applications like Next.js, check out the documentation on [Accessing Data](/next-js/accessing-the-data). To learn about query syntax, visit the [Query Syntax](/development/sdk/query-syntax) documentation.

### Authentication

### Additional features


## Quickstart

If you want to use the SDK with your Next.js application, please refer to the [**Quickstart**](/next-js/quickstart) documentation. It covers the SDK generation using `@roq/cli`, authentication using `@roq/next.js`, and a simple data access to BaaS.
