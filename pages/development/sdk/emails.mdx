# Emails

## Introduction

The Mail API provides a straightforward way to send emails to users. To send emails, we use the `sendMail()` method, which is available through the generated SDK. This method is housed in the ROQ platform and can be accessed using the `roqServerClient` object.

## Code examples

Let's take an example in the Next.js project with the generated SDK installed in the default `src/lib/roq` folder. We can send an email to a user by using the following code: 

```tsx
import { roqServerClient } from '@/lib/roq/roq-server-client';

const sendMyMail = async() => {
    await roqServerClient.roqPlatform.asSuperAdmin().sendMail({
        mail: {
            key: 'onboarding',
            locale: 'en-US',
            emails: ['Fransic84@roq.tech'],
            data: [{ key: 'name', value: 'Francis84 Columbus' }] }
    })
}
```

<Callout type="info">
In the framework such as Next.js. We only can use the `sendMail()` on the server side. Any method from `roqServerClient` is always executed on the server side.
</Callout>

To be able to send an email to a user, we also need to create a mail template in the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech). The mail template is a simple HTML template with some variables. The variables are replaced with the data that we send in the `sendMail()` method. Please check the [mail template](/mails/email-templates-and-customization) section for more information about the mail template.

## Frameworks integration

The Mails API can be used in any ROQ's supported JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit, Express.js, and RedwoodJS. Other than specific ROQ framework packages such as `@roq/nextjs`, there is no need to install any additional packages to use the Mail API. When we generate the SDK using `@roq/cli`, the generated SDK will provide the `sendMail()` method.
