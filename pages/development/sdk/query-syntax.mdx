# Query syntax

In order to interact with the BaaS database by accessing, updating, or deleting data, it's essential to have a good understanding of the query syntax. 


## Syntax comparison 

The query syntax used in BaaS is quite similar to the syntax used in the Prisma ORM. For instance, creating or inserting data into the BaaS database is quite similar to the process in Prisma:

**ROQ**

```tsx filename="ROQ Query"
roqClient.book.create(data, options);
roqClient.book.createMany(data, options);
```
**Prisma**

```tsx
prisma.book.create({ data });
prisma.book.createMany({ data });
```

From the comparison we know that both offer single and bulk creation methods and have the same pattern query syntax:

```shell
roqClient.[entity].[operation](condition)
```

- **entity**: Project entity, representing a specific data model or table. For example: `book`, `review`, `chapter`, etc.
- **operation**: Data operation, such as `create`, `createMany`, `update`, `updateMany`, `upsert`, `delete`, `deleteMany`, `findMany`, `count`, `findManyWithCount`, and `findFirst`.
- **condition**: filter, order by, or args.

## Code examples

```tsx
const bookData = await roqClient.book.findManyWithCount({
		orderBy: { created_at: 'desc' },
		include: {
			review: {
				orderBy: { created_at: 'desc'},
				include: {
					user: {
						include: {
							company: true
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	},{
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
		}
	})	
```
