# User invites

## Introduction

ROQ SDK for BaaS provides a comprehensive user invite solution to be used alongside authentication. The front-end SDK offers an API for user invitation that developers can use directly in their client-side applications.

The user invitation API is part of the ROQ Platform and it also generated by the `@roq/cli` tool on the client side for easy integration with whichever framework you use. On the client side the generated SDK are live by default in the `/lib/roq` folder.

The user invitation API can be accessed through the `roqPlatform` property of the ROQ client, that's the `useRoqClient()` method. So to use it, we can import it like this:

```tsx
import { useRoqClient } from "lib/roq"

const roqClient = useRoqClient()
```

To use any user invitation API we can call it like this:

```tsx
await roqClient.roqPlatform.someUserInvitationMethod()
```

## Code examples

If we want to invite a user, then we should use the `sendUserInvites()`. This method accepts a `userInvites` object as a parameter and the important thing to note is that we can invites many users at once.

This example shows how to invite a user using the `sendUserInvites()` method:

```tsx
import { useRoqClient } from "@roq/nextjs"

const roqClient = useRoqClient()

const tenantId = "tenant_id_here"
const roqUserId = "roq_user_id"

const sendInvitation = async () => {
    const status = await roqClient.roqPlatform.sendUserInvites({
        userInvites: {
            tenantId: tenantId,
            userInvites: [{
                createdByUserId: roqUserId,
                email: email,
                locale: "en-US"
            }]
        }
    })
}
```

You can get the tenant and current user ID from the session data. If you use Next.js, you can go directly [here](/next-js/add-authentication#email-role-and-tenant), where we explain how to get the information from the session data.
