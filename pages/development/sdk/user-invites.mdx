# User invites

## Introduction

In SaaS applications, it is common for users to invite others from their organization, also known as "**tenants**", especially when there is a charge for each user. 

ROQ SDK for BaaS provides a comprehensive user invite solution to be used alongside authentication. The front-end SDK offers an API for user invitation that developers can use directly in their client-side applications.


## How it works

The invitation process is outlined in a series of steps below:

1. **User Initiates Invite:** The process starts with a user's decision to send an invitation.
2. **Invite Sent:** The system activates this method, managing the dispatch of the invitation.
3. **Recipient Receives Invite:** The invitee gets a notification, typically via email or another communication channel.
4. **Invite Accepted or Rejected:** The recipient can choose to either accept or decline the invitation.
5. **Invite Confirmed:** If accepted, the system verifies the invitation, potentially involving further setup for the invitee.
6. **Cancel Invitation:** At any point after sending the invite and before its acceptance, the inviter can opt to cancel the invitation.
7. **End of Flow:** The process wraps up either with the invitee successfully onboarded, the invitation declined, or the invitation canceled.

## Code examples

All user invitation APIs on the client side are live by default in the `/lib/roq` folder and accessible through the ROQ client `useRoqClient()`.

```tsx
import { useRoqClient } from "lib/roq"

const roqClient = useRoqClient()
```

And because user invitation APIs are ROQ platform features, they live not in specific entities but in the ROQ platform. 

For example, if we want to invite a user, then we should use the `sendUserInvites()`:

```tsx
import { useRoqClient } from "@roq/nextjs"

const roqClient = useRoqClient()

const tenantId = "tenant_id_here"
const roqUserId = "roq_user_id"

const sendInvitation = async () => {
    const status = await roqClient.roqPlatform.sendUserInvites({
        userInvites: {
            tenantId: tenantId,
            userInvites: [{
                createdByUserId: roqUserId,
                email: email,
                locale: "en-US"
            }]
        }
    })
}
```
