## Use Custom Domain

For production environments, it's often required to use a custom domain, for example `auth.myproject.com` instead of ROQ's default URLs. 

To change the domain, you need to:

1. Login to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and go to **Application Details** ➔ **Settings** ➔ **Custom Domain**
2. Copy the **CNAME** and set your DNS records at your domain registrar (e.g., Godaddy).
3. Wait a few minutes until this change takes effect, then enter the custom domain and press the **Verify Domain** button.
4. Configure the new URL using the `ROQ_AUTH_URL` variable.
