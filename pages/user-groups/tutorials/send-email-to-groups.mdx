# Send Email to User Groups

<Callout type="info">
To run this code above, you need to:
1. Install `@roq/nodejs` and `dotenv` npm packages. 
2. Get the credentials from ROQ Console and put them in the `.env` file.
3. Make sure there is an email template in ROQ Console with key name `market-research-group-email`. Please, go to this [tutorial](/mails/tutorials/create-email-templates) to create an email template.

## ROQ GraphQL Query

In business applications, it is often necessary to communicate with specific user groups based on their characteristics or behavior. To accomplish this task, we can utilize GraphQL or the [User Groups](/user-groups/api) and [Mails](/mails/api) APIs.

It's easy to query user groups using GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  userGroups {
  	totalCount
    data {
      id
  	  name
  	  reference
      users {
        totalCount
        data {
          id
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We need to filter the response data to obtain the email addresses of users belonging to a particular group. Once we have the required email data, we can use the [`sendEmail()`](/mails/api#sendmail) API to send emails to the group.

The ROQ Node.js SDK provide API to run a GraphQL query natively, its' called `graphqlRequest`, so you don't need to add any additional packages. Here's the simple code how to achieve such a task using ROQ Node.js SDK and GraphQL query:

```js
import 'dotenv/config'
import { Platform } from '@roq/nodejs'

/**
 * Connect to the ROQ Platform
 */
const roqClient = new Platform({
	apiKey: process.env.ROQ_API_KEY,
	environmentId: process.env.ROQ_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
	host: process.env.ROQ_PLATFORM_URL
})

const query = `
{
    userGroups {
  	totalCount
    data {
      id
  	  name
  	  reference
      users {
        totalCount
        data {
          id
		  email
        }
      }
    } 
  }
}
`
const roqGraphQLRequest = await roqClient.asSuperAdmin().graphqlRequest(query);
```

## Send Emails

To send emails we can use one of the user group IDs and filter users emails.

```js
// Suppose you have the group IDs as follows:
const selectedGroupIds = ["554a2843-66dd-4c9a-adc1-0c48484591b6"];
// Filter the groups with the provided IDs.
const selectedGroups = roqGraphQLRequest.data.userGroups.data.filter(group => selectedGroupIds.includes(group.id));

if (selectedGroups.length === 0) {
	console.log("No groups found with the provided IDs.");
} else {
	// Extract the user emails from the selected groups.
	const emails = selectedGroups.flatMap(group => group.users.data.map(user => user.email));
	// Send Emails
	const emailStatus = await roqClient.asSuperAdmin().sendMail({
		mail: {
			key: "market-research-group-email",
			locale: "en-US",
			emails: emails,
			data: [
				{ key: "name", value: "James Davis" },
				{ key: "news_update", value: "the UI Analytics Dashboard is available!" },
				{ key: "your_name", value: "Anna W." },
				{ key: "your_position", value: "AnyVidz CTO" }
			]
		}
	})
	console.log(emailStatus)
}
```
The email for **Market Research** group was sent to every group members.
