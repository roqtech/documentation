# Application Guide

‚ÑπÔ∏è This page describes how to evaluate the new application that you generated using
[AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/).

[//]: # ( TODO This page needs screenshots!!!)

## üåê Visit your application 

    
A few minutes after you finish the AI Assistant, you'll receive an email with a link to your application. On the
homepage, you will find the application's name, a short description, and buttons for registration and login.

On the bottom left, you find an icon showing your user roles and stories. It helps to understand what the
application is doing.

## üë§ Create a new account

Start your discovery by signing up using the upper "register" button. During the registration, you'll be asked
for an account name, typically the name of the user's organization or company. Once this is done, you'll see the
dashboard of the application. Your current role is shown on the top right side. At the moment, you are the owner of this
new account.

On the left side navigation, you see distinct entities of your application. For instance, if you generated an
application that is about "Restaurant management", then the navigation will contain items like "Restaurant", "Table", "
Menus" etc.

Feel free to look around. Behind every navigation item, you find a table that shows the data. You can
click on the "create" button and add some data. There is typically a _main_ entity that you should add. In our
example, it's the "Restaurant" and you should add at least one record here.

## üë• Invite another user

When you are done, click on "Invites" and invite another user to your account. Select a role that makes sense for
you. For instance, in the restaurant example, you would like to invite a "Waiter" to your account. When this is done,
you can log out of the application.

Then open your email client and accept the invite. Now you are logged in to the same account but with a different
role as shown on the top right side.

You may notice that the navigation looks different. That's because this role has different permissions. For instance,
as a "Waiter" you cannot edit the restaurant data, but you can manage reservations. If you need help with what to do in
your application, you can always read the user stories, which you find on the bottom left side of each page. Look around
and create some records. For instance, you may want to add some tables to your restaurant as a waiter.

You can also chat with the other account members or invite other members. When you are done, then log out of the
application.

## üèÅ Login as an end-user

There is a separate registration button if your application has users that don't belong to accounts (often called
end-user). In the restaurant example, these would be the guests of restaurants. In this case, you don't
create an account during signup.

Again, the main navigation looks different, and you can perform other actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Check settings in ROQ Console

Finally, it's worth having a look into your administration backend. Check your emails and find a second email that invites you to ROQ Console. In the Console, you can see all your users and change almost all settings, like
roles & permissions, the registration form look, etc. For detailed first-time use of application console, please readt this [tutorial](/getting-started/tutorials/application-console)
