# Getting Started With ROQ Application Console

After successfully [generating the application](/getting-started/tutorials/generate-application), AI Assistant will send you an email about the access information of the application console. 

## First Registration

For first-time use, you should set a password for the ROQ application console.

Later, if you choose to access the ROQ application console without using a password but using a single sign-on, such as a Google account, ROQ will need your confirmation to merge the account credentials access.
