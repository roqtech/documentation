# How to Generate Application

You generate application by using the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/) that enables you to describe your scenario, define user roles and select additional features. 

## Start to Build

To start generate application you can **Start building from scratch**:

![start build from scratch](/1-start-generate-application.png)

another way os choose one of the pre-built example configurations

## Application Name & Prompt

ROQ's AI Asisstant generate application by using prompt.  

<Callout type="info">
A **Prompt** refers to an initial input given to the AI model, which it then uses to generate output. It's the seed, or the starting point, from which the model generates its response.
</Callout>

For instance the application name is **Bistro**

![prompt](/2-app-name-prompt.png)

For instance, we can give the application data:

* **What is the name of your application?**  _Bistro_

* **What is your application about?** 
  _"Bistro is a food delivery management application, streamlines food delivery operations, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction. It offers centralized order processing, AI-driven demand forecasting, route optimization, and real-time delivery tracking. Its automation features promote operational productivity and business growth."_

ROQ also provides good examples for descriptions. You can have a look at **HR Management Application** or **Car Sharing Application**.

<Callout type="info">
AI is non-deterministic, which means the quality of the generated application heavily depends on your input (application name and prompt). The more details you provide in the AI Assistant, the more accurate your application will be generated.
</Callout>


### Prompt Evaluation

ROQ's AI Assistant will evaluate the prompt. Higher percentage of prompt evaluation will give the best result of the generated application. Of course, you can going back and change the application description to fit you need.
