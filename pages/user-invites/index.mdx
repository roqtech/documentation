# User invites

## Introduction

Especially in B2B SaaS applications, users are expected to invite other users into the same organization (~tenant).
This feature is essential for projects who charge "per seat". ROQ ships with a complete solution for user invites,
which you can use together with [authentication](/authentication).

## How it works

### User invites

By integrating the `<UserInvitesTable />` UI component, you enable users to invite others. The invitee
receives an email with a link to accept the invite. In B2B scenarios, the invited users join the same organization (~
tenant) as the inviting user.

### Role of the invited user

The inviting user can define the role of the invitee. For instance, the new user can be invited as a `member` or `manager`.
This behavior is fully customizable in the ROQ Console.

## UI Components

ROQ’s user invite provides multiple UI components which can be integrated into your application:

1. The [**`<UserInvitesTable />`**](/user-invites/ui-components#user-invites-table) is an
   advanced component that handles the entire logic at once.
2. [**`<UserInvitePane/>`**](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitepane-).
3. [**`<UserInviteButton/>`**](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitebutton-).
