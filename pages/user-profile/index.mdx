# Overview

## Introduction

With ROQ BaaS, you can manage user profiles in your app. The user profile is a set of information about the user, such as name, email, phone number, address, etc.

## API

Read the user profile API documentation [here](/user-profile/api). 

## Managing user profiles

ROQ BaaS SDK provides API to query and manage user profiles. The other way to manage user profiles is through the ROQ Console.

### Managing user profiles using SDK

The typical task of managing a user's profile involves displaying their profile information, providing the ability to edit the profile, including an avatar uploader and then update the profile information.

This [managing user profile](/user-profile/manage-user-profile-using-sdk) documentation section describes how to manage user profiles using ROQ BaaS SDK.

### Managing user profiles using ROQ Console

User profiles can be managed using the ROQ console or SDK, which provides a component and API for profile information management.

To manage user profiles from ROQ Console, go to the **Manage Data** section and select **Users**. Choose on of the user to edit the profile information.
