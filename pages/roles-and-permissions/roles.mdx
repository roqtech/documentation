# User Roles

To manage user roles, navigate to the [Console](https://console.roq.tech) and select **Users Roles**. This section allows you to create, modify, adjust and delete user roles.

Roles are explicitly linked to users and are represented by distinctive names. For example, you might designate roles such as **owner** and **member**. However, you can also refine your categorization using terms that directly correspond to your business context, like **manager**, **chef**, **driver**, **marketing**, or **customer**.

## Role categories

In ROQ, there are two categories of roles: 

- **Roles belonging to Tenant**: This category includes roles that are belong to a tenant. Also, there are two kinds of role-tenants associations:
	1. **Owner of a tenant**: This role is assigned to the user who own a tenant.
	2. **Members of a tenant**: This role is assigned to the users who is a member of a tenant.

    <br/>	
- **End User Roles**: This category includes roles that are assigned to end users and are not associated with any tenant.


## Creating roles

By default, ROQ will provide one role: **Owner**. However, you can create additional roles to meet your business needs.

To create a new user role, click the **+ New Role** button. Suppose you aim to establish a **Marketing** role, you'll need to fill in the required fields: 

- **Name**: Name of the role
- **Key**: Unique key of the role

By default, this new role will lack any platform permissions. Consequently, it's essential to allocate the necessary platform permissions to make the new role functional.

A role can also invite another user. Go here to learn more about [invited roles](#defining-invited-roles).

Conversely, to unassign a role from a user, hover over the existing role and click the cross mark appearing next to the role.

## Deleting roles



## Defining invited roles

A role can invite another user associated with different roles. To specify which roles can be invited, navigate to **Users & Access** → **Roles**. Select a role, then click on **Edit Role** (represented by the keylock icon) → **Invite Roles**. From here, you can choose any other roles that can be invited.
