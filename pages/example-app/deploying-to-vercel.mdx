# Application Deployment on Vercel

There are so many application hosting services. The generated application is Node.js and Next.js based, so as long as the hosting service support that then it will be ok. 

For this documentation, we will use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 
 
## Vercel

There are a few steps that should be done before deploying our generated application into Vercel.

<Steps>
### Create Vercel account

Creating a Vercel account is a straightforward process. Go to [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup). You can choose **Hobby** or **Pro** and name the project whatever you need.

![vercel reg page](/screenshots/vercel-create-account.png)

Vercel will try to connect the new account with git providers or you can use the email instead. You can use any git provider, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and for this documentation, we will use GitHub.

![Vercel git providers](/screenshots/vercel-git-provider.png)


### Import A Project

To import a project, click the **Add New...** → **Project**. This will bring you to importing a project from GitHub.

![vercel importing project](/screenshots/vercel-import-project.png)

<Callout type="info">
Please make sure you have a GitHub account and you application development source code is already pushed into GitHub.
</Callout>

### Deployment Kickstart

For instance, choose **freelancer-inc** into our Vercel project and import it into Vercel.

![Vercel first deployment](/screenshots/vercel-first-deploy.png)

You need to deploy the project first to get into the Vercel project settings. We will set up the environment settings later.

<Callout type="warning">
The deployment will be an error because we haven't set the environment settings yet. After this initial build, we will get the project domain name from Vercel which we will need later for the project environment settings. 
</Callout>

### Setup Environment Variables

To get the project domain name go to the Vercel project **Settings** → **Domains**. For example, the project domain name is `freelancer-inc.vercel.app`. You need to set these fields with the domain name from Vercel:


| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | `https://freelancer-inc.vercel.app` |
| Sign-in URL | `https://freelancer-inc.vercel.app/api/auth/login` |
| Allowed Logout URLs | `https://freelancer-inc.vercel.app/api/auth/logout` |
| Allowed Callback URLs | `https://freelancer-inc.vercel.app/api/auth/callback` |

#### ROQ Console Environments

You need to set this base URL `freelancer-inc.vercel.app` of the project in ROQ Console.

![Vercel base URL ROQ environment settings](/vercel-base-url-roq-env.png)

Make sure you change all base URL settings on ROQ Console, save it, and then click the **Copy Env File** button for the *Extended environment variables for ROQ's authentication feature*. 

Copy all the environment variables and save them somewhere or save them into `.env.prod` file in our locally generated project repository.

#### Vercel Environments

The next step is to import `.env.local` into our Vercel project. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**. 

![vercel import settings](/vercel-import-env.png)

and then click the **Import** button

![vercel import envs](/vercel-import-env-2.png)

<Callout type="info">
At this stage, the project can be redeployed manually from the Vercel Deployment tab. The build process will be successful; however, please note that creating an account is currently not possible as the database has not been set up yet.
</Callout>

{/*
### Setup PostgreSQL

We will use the PostgreSQL database. This database is supported by Vercel and it's quite easy to set up.

![Create vercel database](/vercel-create-database.png)

To create a **Postgres** database click the **Create** button then follow along, give the database name, any name, for example, **bristodb** then click **Create**.

![Create postgres database](/vercel-create-database-postgres.png)

Vercel will populate PostgreSQL credentials and some integrations. What we should pay attention to is the Prisma integration.

![vercel postgres prisma](/vercel-postgres-prisma.png)

We need  to put the Vercel's PostgreSQL Prisma integration code into our generated application's Prisma Schema later but before that, we need to connect the PostgreSQL into our Vercel project.

![connect postgres into vercel project](/vercel-connect-db-project.png)

Connecting PostgreSQL and our project is needed so we don't need to populate environment variables manually on Vercel (_except for the local development_).

<Callout type="warning">
Currently, the Prisma schema in the generated application needs the `uuid_generate_v4()` function. In PostgreSQL, this function is in the `uuid-ossp` extension so you need to enable it. Please look into this [documentation](/faq/troubleshooting/error-postgresql-migration) and make sure to connect to the PostgreSQL on Vercel.
</Callout>


### Local Project Changes

<Callout type="info">
To set up the repository, and set up and run the locally development, please look into these documentations: [Application Development](/development-guides/generated-applications/app-development) and [Run Local Development](/development-guides/generated-applications/run-local-development).
</Callout>

In the local generated application project, edit the Prisma schema `datasource db` into:

```js
//prisma\schema.prisma

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL") // uses connection pooling
  directUrl = env("POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING") // uses a direct connection
}
```

and change the `postinstall` script on `package.json` file into:

```js
"postinstall": "prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy"
```

The `postinstall` will try to generate SQL and apply any changes to PostgreSQL. Commit the changes and push them to GitHub and Vercel will automatically pick up the changes and build the project.

### Installation Test

To test the installation, open the browser and go to the project URL.
