# Chakra demo app


## What we will build?

Let's name the app as **Curriculum Creators**. 

It is a SaaS platform that connects schools and educational institutions with freelance educators and content creators.

## Use AI Assistant

To generate app, go to the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/).

<Steps>
### App name and prompt

First screen is, you need to provide information about the application.

![app-name-prompt](/screenshots/01-app-name-and-prompt.png)

There are two fields to fill in or two questions to answer:	

- **What is the name of your application?**
  This is the name of the application an it's a reference to generate the application name.

- **What is your application about?**
  It's a short description of the application. This will be use as the prompt by AI Assistant to generate the application.

### User setup

The user setup wizzard will guide you and generate the user roles.

There are few questions to answer and the questions depends on the previous answers. For examples:

- **How do you refer to your business customers?**
	
	This is initially will be generated. However, you have the option to customize the type of your business. Examples: Institution, School, Academy, etc. Suppose you choose **Institution**. Then the next question will be:
	
- **What user roles belong to a Institution?**

	These are the roles that belong to the instution. The roles will be generated based on the answer to the previous question. Again, you will have the option to customize the roles. Suppose you choose **School Administrator**, **Content Creator**, and **Curriculum Reviewer**. Then the next question will be:

- **Which user role will have ownership over a Institution account in your SaaS application?**

	The role you choose here will act as the owner of your business customer. This means that this role will have full access to the business customer, allowing it to update the customer's information and invite other users.

	You can choose one of the roles you have previously selected or you can choose a new role. Suppose you choose **School Administrator**. Then the next question will be:

- **Are there any roles of end-users who don't belong to a School?**

	The end-user has its own signup form and doesnâ€™t belong to the Institution. For example, **Freelance Educator**.

### Data model

The data model is the most important part of the application. It's the foundation of the application. The data model will be used to generate the database schema and API.

![Schema editor](/screenshots/03-schema-editor-ai-autofill.png)

The schema editor is a visual tool to create the data model. You can manually add, edit, delete table and create fields as well as the relationship between the tables. You can also use the **AI Autofill** help to generate additional tables and their relationships. 

For a better representation of the data model, AI Assistant also provide schema diagram visualization. So, you can see the relationship between the tables easily.

For more information about the schema editor, please refer to the [schema editor](/schema-editor) section.

### Access management

This screen is to setup the user access management. You can setup the access management manually or use the **AI Autofill** to help generate initial permissions and refine them later.
