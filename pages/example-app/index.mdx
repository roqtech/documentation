# Getting started

ROQ enables you to generate a backend SaaS application that serves as a Backend service or BaaS API. With this API, you can further develop your front-end application using any JavaScript framework.

## Generate app

To generate a new BaaS API, please follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Use ROQ Console

Start your journey by signing up at the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech).

### Create a new application

ROQ Console will guide you through the process of creating a new application.

If you already have an account, just click the **+ Add Application** button to create a new application.

### Generate application

The app generation typically takes a few minutes. Once complete, a checklist will guide you through configuring the application. You may mark it as done if you have already configured it.

### Continue development

By default, ROQ Console will create a **Local Development** environment. What you need the most for the development is the environment variables. You can copy and use these environment variables to start a new development using any ROQ's supported JavaScript frameworks, such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, React + Express.js, Vue.js, SvelteKit, and RedwoodJS.

→️ To start development using Next.js, read this [quickstart](/next-js).

### Launch

Before you publish your application, make sure to configure the **Domain and URLs** section in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) to meet your deployment environment and then copy the new environment variables from ROQ Console to your project `.env` file.

</Steps>

## Technology stack

ROQ's app generator builds a fully functional application based on your input. The resulting application follows the best practices of the
underlying frameworks. If you are familiar with them, there won't be any surprises.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Hosting

Since you will develop an application using any supported JavaScript frameworks and using ROQ BaaS API, your application can be easily deployed to any PaaS solution like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/).
