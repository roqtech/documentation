# Getting started

ROQ enables you to generate an entire SaaS application. The generated application is only generated once and will not update if there are schema changes. The generated application consists of two parts: user interface and backend API that serve as a Backend as a service or BaaS API. The user interface will not updated if you change the schema. However, the BaaS API will be updated if you change the schema.

## Generate app

Follow these steps to generate your application:

<Steps>

### Use ROQ Console

Start your journey by signing up at the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech).

### Create a new application

To create a new application, click the **+ Add Application** button.

### Generate application

The app generation usually takes a few minutes. When it's done, you will have a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) API and options to manage your users and fine-tune all configurations in the ROQ Console.

### Continue development

By default, ROQ Console will create a **Local Development** environment. What you need the most for the development is the environment variables. You can copy and use these environment variables to start a new development using any ROQ's supported JavaScript frameworks, such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, React + Express.js, Vue.js, SvelteKit, and RedwoodJS.

→️ For Next.js you can read this easy [quickstart](/next-js) to get started.

### Launch

Before you publish your application, make sure to configure the **Domain and URLs** section in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/).

</Steps>

## Technology stack

ROQ's app generator builds a fully functional application based on your input. The resulting application follows the best practices of the
underlying frameworks. If you are familiar with them, there won't be any surprises.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Hosting

Since you will develop an application using any supported JavaScript frameworks and using ROQ BaaS API, your application can be easily deployed to any PaaS solution like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/), etc.
