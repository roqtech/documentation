# Getting started

ROQ enables you to generate an entire SaaS application. The generated application is only generated once and will not update if there are schema changes. The generated application consists of two parts: user interface and backend API that serve as a Backend as a service or BaaS API. The user interface will not updated if you change the schema. However, the BaaS API will be updated if you change the schema.

Here, you can see the entire user journey from the start using the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/) until the launch of your application. 


## Generate app

Follow these steps to generate your application:

<Steps>

### Use AI Assistant

Start your journey by using the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/) that enables you to describe your scenario and define user roles, schema, and permissions.

### Get access to your generated application

The app generation usually takes around 15 minutes. When it's done, you get an email to manage your project in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/), where you can manage your users and fine-tune all configurations. 

If you are satisfied with the results, proceed here; otherwise, you can regenerate the backend API with schema changes and give it another try, or you can regenerate the whole application by using the AI Assistant again (step 1). AI isn't deterministic, meaning every run will result slightly differently.

### Continue development

We recommend logging in to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and creating a new environment so that you are not using the same environment as the deployed application, which can result in side effects, e.g., when you change the application's URL.

For continued development, use the BaaS API from the generated application with supported JavaScript frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, React + Express.js, Vue.js, SvelteKit, and RedwoodJS.

### Launch

Before you publish your application, creating a **production** environment in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and using these environment variables is essential.

## Technology stack

ROQ's app generator builds a fully functional application based on your input. The resulting application follows the best practices of the
underlying frameworks. If you are familiar with them, there won't be any surprises.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Hosting

Since you will develop an application using any supported JavaScript frameworks and using ROQ BaaS API, your application can be easily deployed to any PaaS solution like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/), etc.
