# Chakra Demo App

ROQ enables you to generate an entire SaaS application. Here you can see the entire user journey from the start using the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/) until the launch of your application. 

## Generate App

We will generate app using The generated application is only generated once and will not update if there are schema changes. Follow these steps to generate your application:

<Steps>

### Use AI Assistant

You start your journey by using the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/) that enables you to describe your scenario, define user roles and select additional features.

### Get access to your generated application

The app generation usually takes around 15 minutes (see [how it works](/getting-started/how-it-works)). When it's done, you get an email with a link to your new application deployed to Vercel. You are also invited to the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/), where you can manage your users and fine-tune all configurations.

Now it's time to give your new application a test run! If you are satisfied with the results, proceed here; otherwise, you can re-generate your application and give it another try. AI isn't deterministic, meaning every run will result in a slightly different result.

→️ [Application Guide](/getting-started/app-guide)

### Install locally and continue development

In the initial email, you will find a link to the project's source code on GitHub. If you decide to continue your
project, you can clone the code and install the application locally. The application ships with a `README.md` file, which explains how to run it locally. Almost the same way, you can install the application on a provider like Vercel.

We recommend logging in to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and creating a new environment so that you are not using the same environment as the deployed application, which can result in side effects, e.g., when you change the application's URL.

Before coding, look at the [list of used technologies](/getting-started/technology-stack). Have fun!

### Launch

Before you publish your application, it's essential to create a "production" environment in
[ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and use these environment variables.

## How it works

ROQ enables you to generate the first version of your B2B SaaS application in minutes using the
[AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/). This page looks behind the scenes and describes how the generation process
works internally:

| Nr  | Step                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **AI generates project-specific information** | Based on our description, ROQ uses a powerful machine learning model to determine the project's user stories, domain model, and other project-specific information. The quality of this heavily depends on your input. The more details you provide in the [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.ai/), the more accurate your application will be generated. |
| 2   | **Generate Code**                             | All parts of your application will be realized using ROQ's advanced code generator. You get an appealing homepage and navigation that looks different for each user role. All entities can be managed via paginated data-tables and validated forms.                                                                                                  |
| 3   | **Setup of User Management**                  | Every B2B SaaS application has multiple user roles like owner, manager, admin, or customer. ROQ's application generator automatically sets up all these roles. Then it configures the built-in access management that restricts who can do which action and retrieves what data.                                                                      |
| 4   | **Adding Features**                           | Based on your selection, some of ROQ's pre-build features are added and configured automatically: Chat,Notifications, and File-handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | **Publish Code and Deploy!**                  | Before you are informed via email, the resulting application is then pushed to a public repository on GitHub and deployed to a staging environment at Vercel.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Technology stack

ROQ's app generator builds a fully-functional application based on your input (
see [how it works](/getting-started/how-it-works)). The resulting application follows the best practices of the
underlying frameworks. If you are familiar with them, there won't be any surprises.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
* ROQ UI Components and APIs (see below)

### Hosting

It can be easily deployed to any PaaS solution like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/),
[Scalingo](https://scalingo.com/) and connected to a database system that is supported by Prisma, like Postgres, MongoDB
and many more.

### ROQ UI Components and APIs

The application uses ROQ's functional React components and APIs, which enrich your application with functionality like user- and access
management, notifications, chat, and more. 

The integration is realized by the [@roq/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roq/nextjs) library which ships with 
multiple React Components and an API client.
