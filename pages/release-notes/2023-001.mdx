## Authentication

### Default Roles for New Users

You can now define default roles for new users, which will automatically be
assigned upon registration. This feature simplifies user onboarding and ensures that appropriate permissions are granted
from the start.

### Role-Based Invitations

To provide more control over user access, defining which roles can invite other roles is now possible. You can configure
it so that it fits your needs. For instance, as a **member**, you can invite other members but not managers. Just as a
**manager**, you can invite members and managers.

## Multi-Tenancy

### Renaming Multi-Tenancy Entities

Users can now easily rename the multi-tenancy entity (e.g., from _"organization"_ to _"company"_). This feature allows
organizations to customize terminology to better align with their internal structure and language.

### Disabling Multi-Tenancy Settings

For those who do not require multi-tenancy functionality, it is now possible to globally disable multi-tenancy
settings. This option simplifies the platform interface for single-entity organizations.

## Chat system

### Files in `messages()` query

Files are added as nested objects in the response of the `messages()` query.

```graphql
query {
  messages {
    data {
      file {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
