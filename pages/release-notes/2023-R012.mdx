# Demo Data in Generated Apps, Pre-Flight Check & UI Enhancements!

## Adding Demo Data to Your Generated Application

We're thrilled to introduce an exciting enhancement to the generated apps! Now, when you generate your applications, they will include demo data, providing a complete and engaging experience. The demo data allows you to visualize the potential of your applications right from the start, saving time and inspiring creativity. Currently, the demo data consists of lorem ipsum, but soon we will be adding context-specific demo data tailored to your application. 

You also have the flexibility to remove the demo data from the database as needed.

## Pre-Flight Checks in the AI Assistant

We have implemented pre-flight checks in the AI Assistant to enhance your experience. After you write your initial prompt, we evaluate it to ensure that your requirements align with what ROQ can offer. We guide on the missing parts that you need to add to your application to realize it fully.

1. We check for fit, considering anything above 70% as a high fit. Finally, we offer suggestions on what needs to be implemented to complete your product.

In the end, you have 2 choices:

	1. Continue with the evaluated app.	
	2. Change the description of your application if you believe a new score will be better or if you are not satisfied with the evaluation.
