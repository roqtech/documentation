# GraphQL Sandbox

## Introduction

Sometimes it's helpful to run GraphQL queries or mutations directly using the GraphQL Sandbox that you can find here:
https://mars-pp.roq-platform.com/v01/server/graphql

## Instructions

The Sandbox enables you to run any query and mutations and see the generated docs and schema. In addition, it provides
auto-completion, which means you don't need to remember all the names and fields.

If you are not familiar with GraphQL, then it's recommended to start with
the [GraphQL basics guide](/development-guides/graphql-basics-api).

The API of ROQ Platform is protected by two tokens which need to be provided as HTTP headers in this format:

<Tabs items={['HTTP Headers']}><Tab>
```json
{
 "roq-platform-authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...",
 "roq-platform-server-authorization": "Basic M2RkYmZlYmYtO..." 
}
```
</Tab></Tabs>

You can find the tokens of the super admin in the [console](https://console.roq.tech/details).
