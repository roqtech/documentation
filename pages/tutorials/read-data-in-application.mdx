# Read data in application

## Concepts

There are two kinds of read data in ROQ BaaS: **read data without filters** and **read data with filters**.

### Read data without filters

Fetching data without filters means retrieving all records from a particular dataset without any constraints. In the ROQ's generated SDK, this can be done using methods that do not require any arguments that specify filtering criteria.

For example, to retrieve all data from `review` entity using BaaS API, we can use the `findManyWithCount()` method without any arguments. In Next.js 13 or later, we can use the following code:

```tsx
"use client"

import { roqBrowserClient } from "@/lib/roq/roq-client";

const fetchReviewCount = async () => {
    const reviewCount = await roqBrowserClient.review.findManyWithCount();
    return reviewCount;
};

fetchReviewCount().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

### Read data with filters

In this example, we demonstrate how to retrieve and count review data from BaaS using the ROQ SDK using filtering criteria. In Next.js 13 or later, we can use the following code:

```tsx
"use client"

import { roqBrowserClient } from "@/lib/roq/roq-client";

const fetchProjectCount = async () =>{
    const projectCount = await roqBrowserClient.project.findManyWithCount({ orderBy: {
            created_at: 'desc'
        }
    })  
    return projectCount
}
    
fetchReviewCount().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

The important thing to note is that the code syntax for the data operation follows a Prisma-like pattern.

```tsx
await roqBrowserClient.project.findManyWithCount()
```

The benefit of a Prisma-like pattern is easily understood due to its common format: `roqBrowserClient.[entity].[operation]`. Read more about the Prisma-like pattern [here](/development/sdk/query-syntax).

JSON:API is utilized to create REST APIs in ROQ BaaS, resulting in JSON-format response data. For instance, the data response from our earlier code in the browser console:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "7edd49af-4f44-4887-b80b-48e279999614",
            "name": "AI Chatbot",

            "updated_at": "2023-11-11T14:28:12.654Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "8de54627-9f5b-497d-a697-f974c413357d",
            "name": "Refactor User Signup",
            "description": "Modernize the user registration process by integrating a new API to streamline user experience and improve system reliability.",
            "deadline": null,

            "company_id": "22d80a45-0cf6-445d-a5db-f1091c6cb5d6",
            "created_at": "2023-11-10T21:49:52.947Z",
            "updated_at": "2023-11-10T21:49:52.947Z"
        }
    ],
    "count": 2
}
```
