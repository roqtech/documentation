# How to save data in Next.js

In this tutorial we will building a form to save data to ROQ using Next.js. We will use the ROQ SDK to save data to the database. 

Let's build a simple SaaS for works marketplace for freelancers. The application will have two user roles: **Business Owner** and **Freelancer**. The **Business Owner** will be able to create projects and the **Freelancer** will be able to create a freelancer profile and apply to projects.

## Project setup

Before we start, make sure we generate a ROQ project using [AI Assistant](https://app.roq.dev/).

<Steps>
### App name and prompt

For this project, we will use these setup values:

* **App name**: Freelancer Inc.
* **Prompt**: Freelancer works marketplace saas application.

### User setup

Next, we will create initial user roles: 

* **Business Owner**: The owner of the company.
* **Freelancer**: The freelancer that will work in the company and not belong to the company.

### Project schema

For this tutorial we will use this project schema:

![freelancer project schema](/screenshots/freelancer-inc-project-schema.png)

We can edit schema later in project [Console](https://console.roq.tech/). For more information about schema, please read [schema editor](/schema-editor) documentation.

### Next.js quickstart

Make sure to follow the next steps in this tutorial to create a Next.js project:

- [Next.js Quickstart](/next-js#create-a-nextjs-application)

The quickstart will initialize our freelancer works marketplace project with signup, login, and logout features.

## Basic concepts

There are two kind of ways to save data to ROQ: save data with relations and save data without relations.

### Save data with relations

When dealing with more complex data structures, you might need to save data that includes relationships with other entities. ROQ SDK supports this operation, allowing you to create or update data along with its related entities in a single transaction.

For example, the business owner can create a project with the following code:

```tsx
const company_id = "22d80a45-0cf6-445d-a5db-f1091c6cb5d6"

const refactorProject = async() => {
    const newProject = await roqClient.project.create({
		data: {
		    id: "project_id",
			name: 'AI Story Teller',
			description: 'Create a story teller using OpenAI API and ChatGPT',
			status: 'open',
			created_at: new Date(),
			updated_at: new Date(),
			company_id: company_id
	    }
    });
}
```

From our previous project schema, this project has a relationship with the company entity. To create a new project we need to pass the company id to the project entity.

### Save data without relations

When dealing with simple data structures, you might need to save data that does not include relationships with other entities. ROQ SDK supports this operation, allowing you to create or update data in a single transaction.

For example, to update a company data, we can use the following code:

{/*
[
    {
        "id": "22d80a45-0cf6-445d-a5db-f1091c6cb5d6",
        "description": null,
        "location": null,
        "industry": null,
        "size": null,
        "name": "Freelancer Inc.",
        "created_at": "2023-11-10T08:38:53.524Z",
        "updated_at": "2023-11-10T08:38:53.524Z"
    }
]

*/}

```tsx
const updateCompany = async () => {
    const updateCompanyResult = await roqClient.company.update({
	    data: { 
			description: "Top projects marketplace where you can work everywhere.",
			location: "Worldwide", 
			industry: "Internet", size: "1001-5000" },
		    where: {
			    id: "22d80a45-0cf6-445d-a5db-f1091c6cb5d6"
		}
	},)
}
```

From our previous project schema, this company does not have any relations, so we can update it directly in other words, we can update it without relations.
