# Query data

This tutorial will guide you to query data from ROQ BaaS database using ROQ generated SDK on client side. All database operation such as read and write data can be done through `useRoqClient()` method.

## Preparation

Before we start, make sure you have completed the following steps:

- [Next.js Quickstart](/next-js).

## Query data without filters

Fetching data without filters means retrieving all records from a particular dataset without any constraints. In the ROQ SDK, this can be done using methods that does not require any arguments that specify filtering criteria.

For example, to retrieve all reviews data from BaaS:

```tsx {4}
import { useRoqClient } from 'lib/roq';

const fetchReviewCount = async () => {
	const reviewCount = await roqClient.review.findManyWithCount();
	return reviewCount;
};

fetchReviewCount().then((data) => {
	console.log(data);
});
```

## Query data with filters

In this example, we demonstrate how to retrieve and count reviews data from BaaS using the ROQ SDK using filtering criteria.

```tsx {4,5,6,7}
const roqClient = useRoqClient()

const fetchReviewCount = async () =>{
    const reviewCount = await roqClient.review.findManyWithCount({ orderBy: {
	        created_at: 'desc'
	    }
    })	
	return reviewCount
}
	
fetchReviewCount().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

The important thing to note that the code syntax for the data operation follows a Prisma-like pattern.

```tsx
await roqClient.review.findManyWithCount()
```
The benefit of a Prisma-like pattern is easily understood due to its common format: `roqClient.[entity].[operation]`.

JSON:API is utilized to create REST APIs in ROQ BaaS, resulting in JSON-format response data. For instance, the data response from our earlier code in the browser console:
