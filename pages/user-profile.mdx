# User Profile

## Introduction

There are two ways to add a user profile management to your application:

* Implement your own user profile management using API.
* Use the user profile component from ROQ Baas SDK to your application.


## Add user profile component

You can use the user profile component from the ROQ BaaS SDK. It can be used to show the user's profile information, along with the ability to edit the profile. It includes an avatar uploader, and a form to edit the user's password, and other profile information.

To add the user profile component to your app, import the component from the SDK and add it to your page. This an example using the component in a Next.js app:

```tsx
import AppLayout from 'layout/app-layout';
import { UserProfile } from '@roq/nextjs';
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';

export default function ProfilePage() {
  return (
    <AppLayout>
      <Box w={{ base: '100%', md: '70%', lg: '70%', xl: '50%' }}>
        <UserProfile />
      </Box>
    </AppLayout>
  );
}
```

The user profile component will be shown as below:

## Managing user profiles

User profiles can be managed using the ROQ console or SDK, which provides a component and API for profile information management.

To manage user profiles from ROQ Console, go to the **Manage Data** section and select **Users**. Choose on of the user to edit the profile information.
