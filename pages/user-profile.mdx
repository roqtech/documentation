# User Profile

## Introduction

The SDK for ROQ BaaS provides a user profile component. It can be used to show the user's profile information, along with the ability to edit the profile. It includes an avatar uploader, and a form to edit the user's password, and other profile information.

## Managing user profiles

User profiles can be managed using the ROQ console or SDK, which provides a component and API for profile information management.

To manage user profiles from ROQ Console, go to the **Manage Data** section and select **Users**. Choose on of the user to edit the profile information.
