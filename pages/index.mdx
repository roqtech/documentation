## About ROQ

ROQ is a managed backend for multi-tenant SaaS applications.
It enables you to access your database directly from the client side without worrying about permissions and security.
Other Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions exist primarily for mobile or single-page applications and lack support for
complex use cases involving multiple user roles or organizations. ROQ, however, is tailored for multi-tenant
applications such as B2B SaaS, Customer Portals, or B2B2C Marketplaces. It simplifies data layer configuration and
enhances user experience and security with its advanced features:

- Secure access to data from the client-side
- Managed Postgres database with instant REST API
- Authentication with 2FA and social logins
- Organizations (multi-tenancy)
- Roles & Permissions (RBAC)
- File handling
- Emails
