# How to send emails

There are a few steps to send emails using ROQ BaaS SDK: You need to configure an email provider, you need to create an email template, and you can send emails via API.

<Steps>
### Configure email provider

Make sure that an email provider is connected and activated. You will find a list of all integrations in the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). To set up the email integration, please read this [documentation](/mails#integration-with-email-service-providers) section.

### Create an email template

Before sending emails, make sure to create email templates on the ROQ Console. To create an email template, read this [documentation](/mails/email-templates-and-customization).

### Send emails via API

Emails are sent using the [sendMail API](/mails/api#sendmail). You need to use the same key which you set to the email type. For instance, to send a new product email with the unique key `product-name` and data variables: `recipients_name` and `product_name`, you can send the email using the `sendMail()` API in the generated SDK.

In a framework like Next.js, the `sendMail` API can be called in the server-side code. For example, in Next.js 14 and later, you can call the API by using [**Server Actions**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) features.

```ts filename="actions.ts"
"use server"

import { createServerClient } from "@/lib/roq/roq-server-client";

export default async function Actions() {
    const roqServerClient = createServerClient()

    const sendEmailConfirmation = await roqServerClient.roqPlatform.asSuperAdmin().sendMail({
        mail: {
            emails: ["francis.84p@gmail.com"],
            key: "product-name",
            data: [
                { key: 'recipients_name', value: 'Francis Bacon' }, 
                { key: 'product_name', value: 'Bacon' }],
            locale: "de-DE"
        }
    })
}
```

With the `use server` directive, you can call the API directly in the Next.js Client Component. For example:

```ts filename="page.tsx"
import sendMailAction from "./actions.ts"

export default function SendEmail() {
    const sendEmail = async () => {
        await sendMailAction()
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={sendEmail}>Send Email</button>
    )
}
```
