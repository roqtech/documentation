# Email templates and customization

Before sending any emails you have to create a new email template and define a unique key in ROQ Console.

<Callout type="info">
ROQ already provides email templates for *user invitation mail*, *reset password mail*, and *email confirmation* for usage such as registration confirmation. 
</Callout>

## Email templates

### Add Templates

To create a new email template, go to **Transactional Mails** â†’ **Templates** menu.

### Deleting Templates

To delete an email template, click the **Trash** button and confirm the deletion.

<Callout type="warning">
Be careful to delete any email template on ROQ Console. Make sure the email template is not used in any application code because it will make a runtime error if there is a code that sends an email with a nonexisting email template.
</Callout>

### Template Content

The email content support custom variables which you can set later through code. Basically, you can create any text for the email content. You can use placeholders or variables for any content you submit in the `data` parameter of the [sendMail API](/mails/api#sendmail).

For instance using HTML content as a template for a **New Product Release** with custom variables: `recipients_name`, `website_url`, `support_contact`, `your_name`, `your_position`, and `your_contact_information`.
