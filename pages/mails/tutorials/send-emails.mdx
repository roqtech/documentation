# How to Send Emails

To send emails via ROQ's API, you need to perform these steps:

## Configure Email Provider

Make sure that an email provider is connected and activated. You will find a list of all integrations in the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). To set up the email integration, please read this [documentation](/mails/integration).

## Create Email Template

Before sending emails, make sure to create email templates on ROQ Console. Read this [documentation](/mails/tutorials/create-email-templates) to create email template.

## Send Emails via API

Emails are sent using the [sendMail API](/mails/api#sendmail). You need to use the same key which you set to the email type. For instance to send a **New Product News** email with the unique key `new-product-news` and have data variables: `recipients_name`, `website_url`, `your_name`, `your_position`, and `your_contact_information`, you can send the email by using Node.js SDK


```ts copy
await client.asSuperAdmin().sendMail({
  mail: {
      key: "new-product-news",
      locale: "en-US",
      emails: ["test@randomemail.com"],
      data: [   
      {
        key: "recipients_name",
        value: "exampleValue"
      }, 
      {
        key: "website_url",
        value: "exampleValue"
      }, 
      {
        key: "your_name",
        value: "exampleValue"
      }, 
      {
        key: "your_position",
        value: "exampleValue"
      }, 
      {
        key: "your_contact_information",
        value: "exampleValue"
      }, 
    ]
  },
});
```
