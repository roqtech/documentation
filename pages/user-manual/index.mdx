# Manual for Gettit

## Introduction

Welcome to the user manual of your new SaaS application **Gettit**, which was generated
using [ROQ.ai](https://www.roq.ai/). This page explains the main concepts of your project and how to use and develop it
further into a production-ready application.

You should consider **Gettit** as an early version of your application. It already has a data model which should be
close to how you imagined it (if it isn't, you can iterate on it, see below). There are user roles (Owner, Manager,
Employee and Guest) in place and lots of
functionality is already realized; see [feature overview](https://docs.roq.tech/). However, the application is
not 100% done and needs to be finalized. For this purpose, we prepared a checklist for the
engineers [here](/user-manual#development-checklist).

## Short description of your application

[//]: # (Generated text)

[//]: # (GPT-4)

[//]: # (Summaries this app in less than 350 chars. )

[//]: # (The app is called Gettit.)

[//]: # (Text characteristics: formality needs to be "formal". The intent is to "describe". The audience is "knowledgeable".)

Gettit is a comprehensive IT Management Platform designed for SMEs. It enables the Owner to establish an Organization,
manage roles, and control access to the platform. Managers can oversee mobile devices within the Organization while
Employees can manage their assigned devices. Guests can also request temporary access, ensuring flexibility in device
usage.

## Getting started

The goal is to get an early version of your next SaaS application. To get the best results quickly, we recommend to
proceed with these steps:

### (1.) Explorer your application

[//]: # (Replace the words Organization and Owner&Manager with the actual names)
Log in to your application [Gettit](https://tablereserve-v2-3a64.vercel.app/) and register as a user.
For instance, you can create a new Organisation. As an Owner, you can invite other users, e.g., as a Manager.

[//]: # (if end-use exists:)

Alternatively, you can sign up as a(n) Guest and perform various actions.

If you feel lost and don't know what to do, then we recommend reading
your [custom user stories](/user-manual#user-stories-in-detail) first.

### (2.) Adjust and regenerate

[//]: # (TODO describe the regenerate button)

We hope the application is close to how you imagined it. However, often the first generated version isn't perfect, and
you want to adjust it. In this case, log in to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and hit the "regenerate" button.
This will open a dialog enabling you to directly adjust the user stories and data model. This way, you have much better control over the results.

You can regenerate your application multiple times. When you are satisfied with the result, proceed with the next step.

### (3.) First-look at the code

Now, it's time to have a look at the source code that was pushed to
Github: [roq-ai/radical-football13-e16e](https://github.com/roq-ai/radical-football13-e16e)

We used the following open-source technologies to generate
**Gettit**:

* Next.js / React
* Prisma ORM
* Chakra UI

If you are experienced with these technologies, the code should be familiar to you as we met their coding
standards. In addition, we are using ROQ's pre-build features for authentication, access management,
notifications, chat, and file handling. You can inform yourself about the code base and features in
our [documentation](https://docs.roq.tech/).

### (4.) Local installation

You can install your application locally in five minutes. The specific instructions are written in
the [README.md](https://github.com/roq-ai/leavemanagements-afe2/blob/main/README.md) that is located in the repository.

It's important to understand that for each application environment, you'll need to create an environment
in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). We already prepared one development environment for you when the app was
created. It's called _Local Development_ and pre-configured for localhost:3000. If there are more engineers, you
should use dedicated environments for each team member to avoid side effects.

We

### (5.) Copy code

We hope you like your application's generated early version and the technologies we chose to implement it. The
generated code is yours, so feel free to copy the entire code base to your own repository. You can pull the code and push it to your repository.

Now it's time to finish the application. We prepared a [here](/user-manual#development-checklist) that gives you some
orientation. In case you are stuck, we are just one message away when you join
our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/roq-community/shared_invite/zt-1ly20yqpg-K03kNGxN1C7G1C0rr3TlSQ).

## User stories in detail

[//]: # (I used GPT-3.5 to format the stories)

[//]: # (Group these user stories by role. Use the role name as a headline. The first role needs to be the owner role. The last role is the end-user &#40;if any&#41;. Don't add any additional text, just the stories, and headlines.)

The following user stories are realized in your application:

#### Owner

1. As an Owner, I want to create an Organization so that I can manage my SME's mobile devices.
2. As an Owner, I want to invite Managers and Employees to join the Organization so that they can access the IT
   Management Platform.
3. As an Owner, I want to assign roles (Manager or Employee) to the invited users so that they have the appropriate
   permissions within the platform.
4. As an Owner, I want to remove users from the Organization so that I can maintain control over who has access to the
   IT Management Platform.

#### Manager

5. As a Manager, I want to view the list of mobile devices within the Organization so that I can monitor and manage
   them.
6. As a Manager, I want to add new mobile devices to the Organization so that they can be managed within the IT
   Management Platform.
7. As a Manager, I want to update the details of a mobile device so that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
8. As a Manager, I want to remove a mobile device from the Organization so that it is no longer managed within the IT
   Management Platform.
12. As a Manager, I want to approve or deny Guest access requests to mobile devices so that I can maintain control over
    who can use the Organization's devices.

#### Employee

9. As an Employee, I want to view the list of mobile devices assigned to me so that I can access and manage them.
10. As an Employee, I want to update the details of a mobile device assigned to me so that the information is accurate
    and up-to-date.

#### Guest

11. As a Guest, I want to request access to a mobile device within the Organization so that I can temporarily use it for
    a specific purpose.

## Development checklist

To finish ***Gettit**, you'll need to implement these scope items:

[//]: # (Some of these items in the checklist are AI-generated!!!)

1. Design - The generated application probably differs from what you wished for. Feel free to adapt it to your needs.
2. Deployment - The generated application is based on Next.js, which can be seamlessly deployed to Vercel by following
   their [instructions](https://vercel.com/docs).
3. Custom logic - Integration with various apartment rental platforms is needed. 
4. Integrations - Integration with various apartment rental platforms is needed. 
5. ROQ Features - Login to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and make sure all features are configured
   correctly (e.g., check your emails and notifications)
